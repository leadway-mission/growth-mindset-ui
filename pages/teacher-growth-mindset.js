                    Teaching the concept of a growth mindset helps me develop a growth mindset for teaching. This helps me cultivate an environment that promotes and nurtures a positive mindset towards learning, which helps nurture a growth mindset in the classroom. I realized that I could have a growth mindset and a fixed mindset in another area. For example, during building pyramids for our Egypt unit, I was afraid that students would be frustrated with the measurement, and I tried to give students printed copies that they could just cut and assemble. At a time, I realized that this was an exploration, I do not need to protect my students from challenges if I want to normalize challenges that lead to productive struggles.

                    I should not be afraid that things may go wrong; instead, learn from every mistake like I used to tell students. I took up the challenge with help from my CT, and everything went well. I would not have known this if I didn't try at all. Students were engaged, persistent, focused, asked questions, and problem-solving during the pyramids task. However, many of the students tried a couple of times. A particular student started four different times afresh. At the time, I was worried for him, but he said, "no worries, Mrs. O., I got this. I know I can do it. Though it may take time, I will."(Joe) And he did. It was a moment of joy for me. Joe’s comment showed that he was patient, focused, persistent, engaged, learned from each mistake, he was not frustrated; this was the goal. I see a growth in his mindset.

                    So, I model what I want to see in my students.  I encourage students to ask questions; I know that it takes courage to ask questions, so I respectfully answer student questions in a probing manner. I learn to be persistent and not protect students from challenges. It all added up to nurturing a growth mindset in the classroom when I was still teaching the role of success and failure in the concept of the growth mindset.
