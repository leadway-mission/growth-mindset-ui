                    As simple as feedback sounds, it is not all that easy to give descriptive and timely feedback that meets students' specific and unique needs, particularly with the concept of a growth mindset. Feedback is connected to promoting and nurturing a growth mindset as it helps students know what to do and how to get better at what they are doing. It increases student's engagement and motivation for learning. You can not continue telling students to work hard and keep trying without giving them the resources to succeed (Dweck, 2009). One of the tools that I used to nurture a growth mindset is giving descriptive and timely feedback, orally and in writing.

                    I struggled a lot not to praise smartness or the person. I was careful with my words and the use of languages that promote a growth mindset throughout my teacher's inquiry. I learned to praise their process, perseverance, effort, strategies, and improvement. Praising the process promoted and emphasized learning and resilience (Dweck, 2009). If a student struggles despite the effort, I try to encourage the students that the struggles are productive, then suggest new strategies to solve the problem.

                    I then praise the student for investing so much effort and time (Helene Zeeb, Julia Ostertag, and Alexander Renkl towards a GMS). For example, during the cube problem-solving task, the oral feedback that I gave the encouraged students that some of them to put more effort, got engaged, and persevere, some asked for permission to take the task home to continue to work on it, though it was not the best thing to do, I saw their growth and the desired to continue growing which also speaks to my flexibility as well. It nurtured the act of decision-making with my students. It also helps me with what to do as a whole class and as well for the individual student. However, it takes time, but it is worth it. Sometimes, some students asked if they could redo their work from the feedback. I allow it because it is their understanding and the process that matters. For oral feedback, instead of saying students are right or wrong, I ask them to tell me more about how they got to that conclusion. This helps students to evaluate their thinking.  I experience success with engagement, perseverance, and manageable tasks. Below is the feedback to Janet's reflection after completing her problem-solving task.
