                    I notice that teaching the concept of growth mindset helps nurture a growth mindset in the classroom, just like Carol Dweck recommended. Do not assume that every student in your classroom understands the concept. initially, I ASSUMED that my students understand the concept of growth mindset because the school was having a project on grit grid using the circle of courage as bases. I was among the mastery team which has things in common with a growth mindset and all I was doing was reinforcing the growth mindset without teaching the concept first. It was not really working, but when I turn to the explicit teaching of the concept, how the brain work (Carol Dweck, who will the 21st- learners be?), and reinforcing it, I notice a drastic growth in their ability to take challenges because they now understand that perseverance through challenges make our brain grow and it is a productive struggle; which promote and nurture their growth mindset. Student level of engagement was also increased because they understand that they can grow intelligent through effort.

                    Understanding how the brain works give student confidence, resilience ( 21st-century learners), and the ability to take risk. This is evident in the rubber band activity and the letter that was written to the future student that may be passing through challenges in one subject or the other. As a class, we always make references to the rubber band moment to keep the energy and engagement level high for any challenging task.  So no assumption, teach the concept of growth mindset explicitly and constantly intervene when you expect some level of engagement with a positive mindset towards challenges by reinforcing and reminding students of the concept. It is not something you are born with or without. You can grow and nurture it. So student shares their own stories of a time when they made their brains smarter through challenges and practices. This gets them to focus on their experience and also connect with others. (Kiger, L.L 2017, Growth mindset in the classroom. They are empowering Researcher for Educators).
